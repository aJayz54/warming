# Introduction

Hey! This is a django program I wrote meant to help educate about some of the lesser known effects of climate change, as well as to experiment with Django, 
accessing online API's, and creating graphs using Plotly. 

# Installation 
There's a requirements.txt file (It's hidden inside the mysite folder... I think I screwed up uploading this entire folder and now I can't really fix it LOL)
But yea just use pip to install the requirements and this should run! cd into the directory and you can use python manage.py runserver to start it up!
